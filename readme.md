## The War Letters

The purpose of this project is to create a content management system that allows for digitizing/transcribing handwritten letters from days gone by.

## Inspiration

My grandparents are gone, but there's a massive pile of letters that they wrote back and forth to each other over the 3 years they were separated during World War II.
